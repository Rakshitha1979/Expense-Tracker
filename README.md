# Expense-Tracker
This is a web-based Expense Tracker application. It allows users to add daily expenses, view them in a list, and delete them. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The backend is built with Node.js and Express. We also designed a database using SQL for the project.
The files are organized into separate Frontend and Backend folders. You can run the project by installing Node.js and typing node app. js in the terminal. 
Currently, the spending data is stored temporarily in memory.
